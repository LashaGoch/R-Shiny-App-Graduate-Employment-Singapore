## Description

This project is aimed at providing visualizations of graduates employment survey in Singapore. We selected two parameters: gross monthly income and full time employment rate, which we believe are to be of interest for most students. Users are able to check or compare gross monthly income and full time employment across different universities/programs/year.

The data is provided by Ministry of Education in Singapore based on graduates employment survey across different universities. We believe that this project can be served as a reference for senior students who are currently looking for jobs or a guideline for prospect students.

The data is available on [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/).
